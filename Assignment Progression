  I posted and submitted my essay for GitHub.  I have also decided to set up this branch to not only practice and test out the GitHub
  but so that I can update my progression for the assignments.  Based off the industry that I am getting in, I feel that getting into
  the habit of always documenting everything within project progression and completions.  Once I get into the routine of things, it 
  will become second nature for me and that is what I want to constantly focus on, becoming routined to the industry standards to 
  become successful
